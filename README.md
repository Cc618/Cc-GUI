# Cc-GUI
A library for GUI in Python with Pygame

## How it works ?
Like many other libraries this library is object oriented,
it means that all the widgets inherit from a base class, the Widget class.

## The Standard Widget Library (SWL)
(Not implemented yet)
The library needs just the core to works (just cc_gui.py) but there is no widgets,
if you want some basics widgets like buttons or text edits you may use this library.

## Themes
(Not implemented yet)
Themes are a feature to change the look of your app quickly.
#### There are 3 categories of colors:
- Primary : For important widgets
- Secondary : Other important widgets
- B&W : Shades of grey for panels, texts etc..
